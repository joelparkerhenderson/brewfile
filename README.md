# Brewfile

We use Homebrew a.k.a. Brew to install software on our macOS computers.

See http://brew.sh/ and http://homebrew-file.readthedocs.io/

This repository has our Brewfile, which has everything we use in all our projects. This includes plenty of desktop applications, system tools, programming languages, and more.

Using a Brewfile helps us with our Infrastructure as Code (IaC) initiatives.

Feedback welcome. Pull requests welcome.
